# Powershell
PS Script Dump...

SendEmail.ps1:
This was created to send an email to a distribution group when a automated export task had completed exporting a spreadsheet of customer info and a batch file ((https://github.com/andrew77768/Batch/blob/master/ANPRMove.bat)) had moved this from a server to a share before triggering SendEmail.ps1. This was to prompt a user to move a spreadsheet of customer info into the LPR system, so it had an updated DB to use for triggering notifications.

Unfortunately, I never saved the full script on completion (importing into the LPR and merged everything to one file/lang(Py)) before I moved onto better things.

This won't be updated but will be reused.





BTECRandomPWGenerator.ps1:
Maybe add shapes, animals or some verbs or something??? Make it more fun??
